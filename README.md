## DATA 512 - HOMEWORK 2 : Considering bias in Data

The goal of this assignment is to explore the concept of bias in data using Wikipedia articles. This assignment will consider articles about cities in different US states. For this assignment, you will combine a dataset of Wikipedia articles with a dataset of state populations, and use a machine learning service called ORES to estimate the quality of the articles about the cities.
An analysis is performed on how the coverage of US cities on Wikipedia and how the quality of articles about cities varies among states. The analysis consists of a series of tables that show:
* The states with the greatest and least coverage of cities on Wikipedia compared to their population.
* The states with the highest and lowest proportion of high quality articles about cities.
* A ranking of US geographic regions by articles-per-person and proportion of high quality articles.
